2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/noesis-ai-tutor.git
   cd noesis-ai-tutor
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment** (see [Technical Setup](TECHNICAL_SETUP.md))
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
6. **Test your changes** thoroughly
7. **Commit your changes** with clear messages
8. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
9. **Open a Pull Request** with a detailed description

### Coding Standards

#### File Organization
- Keep related files together
- Use descriptive file and directory names
- Follow existing project structure

#### HTML/Liquid Templates
```liquid
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<article class="subject-card">
  <h2>{{ subject.title }}</h2>
  <p>{{ subject.description }}</p>
</article>

<!-- Handle edge cases gracefully -->
{% if site.subjects.size > 0 %}
  {% for subject in site.subjects %}
    <!-- content -->
  {% endfor %}
{% else %}
  <p>No subjects available.</p>
{% endif %}
```

#### CSS/SCSS
```scss
// Use meaningful class names
.subject-card {
  background: var(--card-background);
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
  
  // Group related properties
  &:hover {
    transform: translateY(-2px);
    box-shadow: var(--shadow-lg);
  }
}

// Use CSS custom properties for consistency
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --spacing-sm: 0.5rem;
  --spacing-md: 1rem;
}
```

#### Markdown Content
```markdown
---
title: "Clear, Descriptive Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO and navigation"
category: "setup|guides|tools"
order: 1
---

# Page Title

Brief introduction paragraph.

## Main Sections

Use meaningful headings that create a logical hierarchy.

### Subsections

Keep content scannable with:
- Bullet points for lists
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- `code blocks` for technical terms

## Code Examples

```bash
# Always include comments explaining commands
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
```

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting a Pull Request:

1. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
2. **Check for broken links**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll build
   # Manually check navigation and internal links
   ```
3. **Validate HTML** using browser dev tools
4. **Test responsive design** on different screen sizes
5. **Verify accessibility** with screen readers or accessibility tools

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples
git commit -m "Add mobile-responsive navigation menu"
git commit -m "Fix broken links in framework documentation"
git commit -m "Update algebra subject with new question format"

# Not helpful
git commit -m "Fix stuff"
git commit -m "Update files"
git commit -m "Changes"
```

**Format:**
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Include more details in the body if needed

### Pull Request Guidelines

- [ ] Fork the repository and create a feature branch
