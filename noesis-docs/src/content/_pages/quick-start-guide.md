# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

This guide helps teachers and students get started with subject-specific AI tutors in the Noesis framework.

## üë©‚Äçüè´ For Teachers

### 1. **Review the AI Tutor Configuration**
- Check the [ChatGPT setup guide]({{ '/framework/bot-template/' | relative_url }})
- Review the custom GPT settings specific to your subject
- Understand the prompting strategy and conversation flow

### 2. **Choose Appropriate Questions**
- Browse questions by difficulty level in your subject area
- Consider your students' current skill level
- Select questions that align with your curriculum objectives

### 3. **Set Student Expectations**
- Explain how critical thinking will be assessed
- Show examples of good vs. poor AI tutor interactions
- Emphasize the importance of asking follow-up questions

### 4. **Monitor Student Progress**
- Use our [conversation analysis guide]({{ '/framework/conversation-analysis-guide/' | relative_url }})
- Review student conversation transcripts regularly
- Provide feedback on thinking processes, not just answers

### 5. **Customize for Your Classroom**

- Share successful implementations with the community

## üéì For Students

### 1. **Access Your AI Tutor**
- Use the custom GPT link provided by your teacher
- Make sure you're logged into ChatGPT
- Bookmark the tutor for easy access

### 2. **Start with Your Assigned Question**
- Begin with the specific problem or topic assigned
- Read the question carefully before asking for help
- Be specific about what you're trying to understand

### 3. **Engage in Deep Thinking**
- Don't just accept the first explanation given
- Ask "why" and "how" questions to understand the reasoning
- Request examples or different explanations if needed
- Make connections to what you already know

### 4. **Save and Share Your Conversation**
- Copy the conversation link when you're done
- Share it with your teacher for assessment
- Review your conversation to identify learning gaps

### 5. **Develop Good Habits**
- Always try to solve problems yourself first
- Ask for hints rather than complete solutions
- Verify your understanding by explaining concepts back
- Use the AI tutor as a thinking partner, not an answer machine

## üìä Assessment Focus

Remember, you're being evaluated on your **critical thinking process**, not just getting the right answer. Teachers look for:

- **Quality of Questions**: Do you ask thoughtful follow-up questions?
- **Depth of Exploration**: Do you dig deeper into concepts?
- **Connections**: Do you relate new ideas to prior knowledge?
- **Mathematical Reasoning**: Do you explain your thinking clearly?
- **Verification**: Do you check your understanding and solutions?
