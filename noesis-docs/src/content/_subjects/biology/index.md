Explore the amazing world of living organisms! Biology helps you understand how life works at every level, from molecules to ecosystems.

## What You'll Discover

Biology covers the fundamental principles of life:
- **Cell Biology** - The basic units of life and how they function
- **Genetics** - How traits are passed from parents to offspring
- **Evolution** - How species change and adapt over time
- **Ecology** - How organisms interact with each other and their environment
