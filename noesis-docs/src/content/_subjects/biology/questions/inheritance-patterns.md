## Main Question
**In pea plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant over white flowers (p). If you cross a heterozygous purple-flowered plant with a white-flowered plant, what ratio of flower colors would you expect in the offspring? But more importantly, why does this ratio occur?**

Think about what's really happening during reproduction at the cellular level.

## Key Concepts to Explore
- The relationship between genes, alleles, and traits
- How meiosis creates genetic variation
- The difference between probability and certainty in genetics
- Why some traits are dominant over others
- The connection between molecular genetics and observable traits

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why are some alleles dominant and others recessive?"
- "How do we know which traits will appear in offspring?"
- "What happens if there are more than two alleles for a trait?"
- "Why don't offspring always match the predicted ratios exactly?"
- "How does this relate to human inheritance?"
- "What determines which allele a parent passes on?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask about the molecular basis of dominance
- [ ] Want to understand the role of chance in inheritance
- [ ] Connect genetics to evolution and natural selection
- [ ] Explore exceptions to simple inheritance patterns
- [ ] Ask about the relationship between genes and environment
- [ ] Consider ethical implications of genetic knowledge

## Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student demonstrates understanding of underlying mechanisms, asks thoughtful questions about molecular basis of inheritance, connects genetics to broader biological concepts

**Good (B)**: Student correctly uses Punnett squares, understands probability in genetics, asks relevant questions about inheritance patterns

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student can complete basic Punnett squares but shows limited understanding of underlying biological processes

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student asks for formulas without engaging with the biological meaning of inheritance

## Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: "How do I figure out what the offspring will look like?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! Before we start predicting, let me ask you this: what do you think each parent contributes to their offspring? And why might some traits 'win out' over others in determining what we see?"

**Expected Student Follow-up**: "Each parent gives one allele for each trait?"

**AI Guidance**: "Exactly! Now think about this purple plant with genotype Pp - it has both P and p alleles. During reproduction, which allele do you think it will pass to each offspring? Is there a pattern, or does something else determine this?"

## Teacher Notes
- Emphasize the underlying biology, not just the mathematical patterns
- Connect to real examples students can relate to
- Address common misconceptions about inheritance
- Help students understand probability vs. certainty

## Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- How do linked genes affect inheritance patterns?
- What happens with incomplete dominance or codominance?
- How does genetic testing relate to Punnett square predictions?
- Why might observed ratios differ from predicted ratios in small sample sizes?
