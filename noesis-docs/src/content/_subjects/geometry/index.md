Welcome to Geometry! This course focuses on developing spatial reasoning and logical thinking through the study of shapes, relationships, and proofs.

## What You'll Learn

Geometry builds foundational skills in:
- **Spatial Visualization** - Understanding how shapes relate in 2D and 3D space
- **Logical Reasoning** - Constructing and analyzing mathematical proofs
- **Problem Solving** - Applying geometric principles to real-world situations
- **Mathematical Communication** - Expressing geometric ideas clearly and precisely
