## Main Question
**A farmer has 100 meters of fencing to create a rectangular pen against the side of a barn (so one side doesn't need fencing). What dimensions will give the maximum area?**

More importantly, can you discover a general principle about how area and perimeter relate in optimization problems?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- The trade-off between different dimensions when perimeter is fixed
- How to express area as a function of one variable
- The concept of optimization in geometric contexts
- Why certain shapes are "optimal" for given constraints

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "What if we needed fencing on all four sides?"
- "Does this principle work for other shapes like triangles or circles?"
- "Why does the maximum occur at this specific point?"
- "How would additional constraints change the answer?"
- "What if we wanted to minimize perimeter for a given area instead?"
- "Can I visualize what's happening as the dimensions change?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Question how the constraint affects the possible solutions
- [ ] Want to understand why the optimal solution has specific properties
- [ ] Explore what happens with different constraint values
- [ ] Connect this to real-world design problems
- [ ] Ask about generalizing to other shapes or conditions
- [ ] Investigate the mathematical reasoning behind optimization
- [ ] Show curiosity about related problems (circles, triangles, etc.)

## Additional Exploration
- Compare rectangular, circular, and triangular pens with the same perimeter
- Investigate how the optimal ratio changes with different constraints
- Explore 3D versions (maximizing volume with surface area constraints)
- Connect to calculus concepts (derivatives and optimization)

## Assessment Criteria
Strong responses should include:
- Clear setup of the constraint equation (perimeter = 100)
- Expression of area as a function of one variable
- Method for finding the maximum (completing the square or vertex form)
- Understanding that the optimal rectangle is a square when all sides need fencing
- Recognition that this is a special case due to the barn constraint
- Ability to generalize the approach to similar problems

## Real-World Connections
- Architecture and space planning
- Agricultural field design
- Material efficiency in manufacturing
- Garden and landscape design
- Economic optimization in resource allocation
