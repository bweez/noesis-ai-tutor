## Main Question
**Given two triangles ABC and DEF where AB = DE, AC = DF, and ∠A = ∠D, prove that the triangles are congruent.**

More importantly, can you explain why we need exactly these three pieces of information and not others?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- The difference between the four congruence theorems (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS)
- Why AAA doesn't guarantee congruence
- The logic behind geometric proofs
- How congruence relates to transformations (rotations, reflections, translations)

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why doesn't SSA work as a congruence theorem?"
- "How do I know which theorem to use?"
- "What's the difference between congruent and similar?"
- "Why do we need formal proofs in geometry?"
- "Can I prove congruence with different combinations of sides and angles?"
- "How do I write a clear, logical proof?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Question why certain combinations work while others don't
- [ ] Want to understand the logic behind proof structure
- [ ] Explore counterexamples (like why AAA fails)
- [ ] Connect congruence to real-world applications
- [ ] Ask about the relationship between congruence and similarity
- [ ] Investigate what happens with different given information
- [ ] Show curiosity about the historical development of geometric proofs

## Additional Exploration
- Construct triangles with different given information to test congruence
- Explore how rigid transformations relate to congruence
- Investigate special cases (right triangles, isosceles triangles)
- Connect to coordinate geometry and distance formulas

## Assessment Criteria
Strong responses should include:
- Correct identification of the SAS congruence theorem
- Clear, step-by-step proof structure
- Understanding of why the given information is sufficient
- Ability to distinguish this case from others (like SSA)
- Connection between algebraic reasoning and geometric visualization
