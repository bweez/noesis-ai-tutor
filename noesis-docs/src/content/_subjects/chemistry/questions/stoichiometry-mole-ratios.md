## Main Question
**For the reaction: 2Al + 3CuSO₄ → Al₂(SO₄)₃ + 3Cu**

**If you start with 5.4 g of aluminum and 25.0 g of copper sulfate, which reactant will be completely consumed first, and how much of the product Al₂(SO₄)₃ can be formed?**

But more importantly, can you explain why we need to think about "limiting" reactants and what this tells us about how reactions actually work?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- The mole as a counting unit for atoms and molecules
- How balanced equations provide quantitative information
- The concept of limiting reactants in real-world scenarios
- The relationship between microscopic particle ratios and macroscopic mass ratios

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why can't I just use the masses directly from the equation?"
- "How do I know which reactant will run out first?"
- "What happens to the leftover reactant?"
- "Why is the mole concept necessary for these calculations?"
- "How do chemists use this in real laboratories or industry?"
- "What if the reaction doesn't go to completion?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask about the connection between particle ratios and mass ratios
- [ ] Want to understand why limiting reactants exist in real reactions
- [ ] Explore practical applications of stoichiometric calculations
- [ ] Question what happens to excess reactants
- [ ] Investigate the relationship between theoretical and actual yields
- [ ] Make connections between microscopic and macroscopic perspectives

## Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student demonstrates clear understanding of mole concept as a bridge between scales, systematically approaches limiting reactant problems, asks insightful questions about real-world applications, and connects calculations to chemical reality

**Good (B)**: Student correctly performs stoichiometric calculations, identifies limiting reactants with guidance, and shows understanding of the quantitative nature of chemical reactions

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student can follow calculation procedures but needs support to understand underlying concepts and real-world significance

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student attempts to memorize steps without understanding the chemistry, cannot identify limiting reactants, or shows no curiosity about why these calculations matter

## Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: "How do I solve this stoichiometry problem?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! Before we dive into calculations, let me ask you this: what does the balanced equation tell us about how aluminum and copper sulfate react? What do those coefficients really mean in terms of particles?"

**Expected Student Follow-up**: "The coefficients tell us the ratio? Like 2 aluminum atoms react with 3 copper sulfate molecules?"

**AI Guidance**: "Exactly! Now here's the key question: we have real masses of these substances, not individual atoms. How can we figure out whether we have the right ratio of particles when we're dealing with grams instead of individual atoms?"

## Teacher Notes
- Emphasize the mole as a bridge between atomic and macroscopic scales
- Connect limiting reactants to everyday experiences (like making sandwiches)
- Address the common misconception that the reactant with less mass is limiting
- Help students see stoichiometry as a tool for predicting and controlling reactions

## Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- How do percent yields relate to stoichiometric calculations?
- What role does stoichiometry play in green chemistry and atom economy?
- How do limiting reactants affect reaction kinetics?
- How is stoichiometry used in pharmaceutical manufacturing?
- What happens in reactions with multiple products?
