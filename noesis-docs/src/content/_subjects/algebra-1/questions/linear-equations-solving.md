## Main Question
**Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22**

But more importantly, can you explain why each step you take is mathematically valid?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- Inverse operations and why they work
- The balance/scale model of equations
- Checking solutions by substitution
- The difference between expressions and equations

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why can I subtract 7 from both sides?"
- "How do I know when I've found the right answer?"
- "What if the number in front of x was negative?"
- "Can you show me how to check if my answer is correct?"
- "What would happen if I did the steps in a different order?"
- "Why does this method work for all linear equations?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask about the reasoning behind each step
- [ ] Want to understand why inverse operations work
- [ ] Ask how to verify their solution
- [ ] Explore what happens with different types of equations
- [ ] Make connections to real-world balance/equality concepts
- [ ] Question whether there could be other solution methods

## Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student asks deep questions about why methods work, explores verification strategies, makes connections to the concept of mathematical balance, demonstrates understanding beyond just getting the answer

**Good (B)**: Student asks relevant questions about solution steps, shows understanding of inverse operations, attempts to verify solutions

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student follows the solution process but asks few follow-up questions, shows basic understanding of the mechanics

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student asks for direct answer without engaging with the solution process, shows no curiosity about why methods work

## Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: "How do I solve 3x + 7 = 22?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! Before we solve this, let me ask you something: what do you think this equation is telling us? What does the equals sign mean here?"

**Expected Student Follow-up**: "The equals sign means both sides are equal... so 3x + 7 has the same value as 22?"

**AI Guidance**: "Exactly! So if both sides are equal, what do you think would happen if we did the same operation to both sides? What operation might help us get closer to having x by itself?"

## Teacher Notes
- Emphasize the conceptual understanding over mechanical steps
- Watch for students who want to jump straight to algorithms
- Common misconception: students often want to "move" terms rather than understanding inverse operations
- Connect to balance scales if students struggle with the concept

## Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- What happens when the coefficient of x is a fraction?
- How would you solve 2(x + 3) = 14?
- Can you create a word problem that would lead to this equation?
- What if there were x terms on both sides of the equation?
