## Main Question
**Solve this system using TWO different methods and explain which method you prefer and why:**
```
2x + 3y = 16
x - y = 2
```

But more importantly, what does the solution tell us about where these lines intersect?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- The geometric interpretation of system solutions
- Strategic thinking about method selection
- Why different algebraic approaches yield the same answer
- The relationship between equations and their graphs

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why do both methods give the same answer?"
- "How do I know which method to choose?"
- "What does the solution point represent graphically?"
- "How can I check if my solution is correct?"
- "What would happen if the lines were parallel?"
- "Why does elimination work when we add equations together?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask about the geometric meaning of the solution
- [ ] Want to understand why different methods work
- [ ] Compare the efficiency of different approaches
- [ ] Ask about edge cases (parallel lines, same line)
- [ ] Connect algebraic solutions to graphical intersections
- [ ] Explore verification strategies

## Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student successfully uses both methods, makes strategic decisions about method choice, demonstrates understanding of geometric interpretation, asks insightful questions about the process

**Good (B)**: Student completes both methods with guidance, shows some strategic thinking about method selection, understands basic verification

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student follows procedural steps but shows limited strategic thinking, basic understanding of solution meaning

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student asks for step-by-step instructions without engaging with method comparison or geometric meaning

## Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: "How do I solve this system of equations?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! I notice you have two different methods available. Before we pick one, look at these equations - what do you notice about their structure? Which method do you think might be easier and why?"

**Expected Student Follow-up**: "The second equation has x by itself, so maybe substitution would be easier?"

**AI Guidance**: "Excellent observation! That's exactly the kind of strategic thinking mathematicians use. Now, let's try substitution first, but I want you to think about what we're really doing. What does it mean to substitute x - y = 2 into the first equation?"

## Teacher Notes
- Emphasize strategic thinking over rote application
- Connect to graphical representations when possible
- Encourage students to compare method efficiency
- Watch for students who stick to one method without considering alternatives

## Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- What happens with the system: 2x + 4y = 8, x + 2y = 4?
- How would you solve: 3x - 2y = 7, 5x + 4y = 13?
- Can you create a system where elimination is clearly better than substitution?
- What does it mean graphically when a system has no solution?
