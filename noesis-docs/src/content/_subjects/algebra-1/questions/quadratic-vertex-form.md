## Main Question
**Transform f(x) = x² + 6x + 5 into vertex form and explain what this tells us about the parabola.**

More importantly, can you connect each step of the transformation to what's happening graphically?

## Key Concepts to Explore
- What vertex form reveals about a parabola's shape and position
- The completing the square technique and why it works
- The relationship between algebraic and geometric representations
- How changing parameters affects the graph

## Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- "Why do we call it 'vertex' form?"
- "How does completing the square work?"
- "What does each number in vertex form tell us about the graph?"
- "How can I check if my vertex form is correct?"
- "Why is the vertex important for understanding quadratic functions?"
- "What happens if the coefficient of x² is not 1?"

## Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask about the geometric meaning of algebraic transformations
- [ ] Want to understand why completing the square works
- [ ] Connect vertex coordinates to the algebraic form
- [ ] Explore how different quadratics transform differently
- [ ] Ask about verification methods
- [ ] Make connections between algebra and graphing

## Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student makes strong connections between algebraic manipulation and graphical meaning, asks insightful questions about the geometric interpretation, demonstrates understanding of the transformation process

**Good (B)**: Student successfully completes the transformation with guidance, shows understanding of vertex form's meaning, asks relevant questions about the process

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student follows the mechanical steps but shows limited connection to graphical meaning, asks basic procedural questions

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student asks for step-by-step instructions without engaging with the conceptual meaning, shows no interest in the geometric interpretation

## Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: "How do I convert x² + 6x + 5 to vertex form?"

**AI Response**: "Great question! Before we start transforming, let me ask you: what do you think 'vertex form' means? What information might it give us about the parabola that standard form doesn't make obvious?"

**Expected Student Follow-up**: "Is vertex form supposed to show us where the highest or lowest point is?"

**AI Guidance**: "Exactly! The vertex form makes the vertex location obvious. Now, looking at x² + 6x + 5, the x² and 6x terms are connected. What do you think we need to do to group them in a way that reveals the vertex?"

## Teacher Notes
- Emphasize the geometric interpretation, not just algebraic manipulation
- Watch for students who memorize the algorithm without understanding
- Connect to previous work with factoring and parabola graphing
- Use graphing tools to visualize the transformation

## Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- How would you handle f(x) = 2x² + 8x + 3?
- Can you find the vertex form of f(x) = -x² + 4x - 1?
- What's the relationship between vertex form and the axis of symmetry?
- How does vertex form help with finding the range of a quadratic function?
