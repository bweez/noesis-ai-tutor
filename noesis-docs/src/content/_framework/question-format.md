# Question Format Template

This template helps create effective questions that promote critical thinking and meaningful AI tutoring conversations.

## Question Structure

### Title
[Brief, descriptive title of the question/problem]

### Difficulty Level
- [ ] Beginner
- [ ] Intermediate  
- [ ] Advanced

### Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- [Specific skill or knowledge goal 1]
- [Specific skill or knowledge goal 2]
- [Specific skill or knowledge goal 3]

### Prerequisites
- [Required prior knowledge or skills]
- [Recommended previous topics]

### Main Question
[The primary question or problem students will work on. This should be open-ended enough to allow for exploration but focused enough to have clear learning goals.]

### Key Concepts to Explore
- [Important concept 1]
- [Important concept 2]
- [Important concept 3]

### Expected Follow-up Questions
High-quality student engagement should include questions like:
- [Example follow-up question 1]
- [Example follow-up question 2]
- [Example follow-up question 3]

### Critical Thinking Indicators
Students demonstrate understanding when they:
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions about the problem
- [ ] Break down complex problems into smaller parts
- [ ] Make connections to previously learned concepts
- [ ] Propose multiple solution approaches
- [ ] Question their own assumptions
- [ ] Seek to understand "why" not just "how"

### Assessment Criteria
**Excellent (A)**: Student asks deep follow-up questions, makes connections, challenges assumptions, demonstrates metacognitive thinking

**Good (B)**: Student asks relevant follow-up questions, shows understanding of key concepts, engages meaningfully with the AI

**Satisfactory (C)**: Student completes the basic question but asks few follow-up questions, shows surface-level understanding

**Needs Improvement (D/F)**: Student asks no follow-up questions, accepts first answer without exploration, shows minimal engagement

### Sample Conversation Flow
**Student Initial Question**: [Example of how a student might start]

**AI Response**: [Example of how the tutor should guide]

**Expected Student Follow-up**: [What the student should ask next]

**AI Guidance**: [How the AI should continue to guide]

### Teacher Notes
- [Implementation tips]
- [Common student misconceptions to watch for]
- [Suggestions for classroom follow-up]

### Extensions
For advanced students or further exploration:
- [Related questions or problems]
- [Real-world applications]
- [Cross-curricular connections]
