# 👩‍🏫 Teacher Tools & Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Noesis AI Tutor Framework! This guide will walk you through everything you need to successfully implement AI tutoring in your classroom.

## 🎯 Quick Start Overview

The Noesis framework creates a structured learning environment where students engage with AI tutors to develop critical thinking skills. Here's how it works in your classroom:

### The Student Learning Workflow

1. **📋 Teacher Assigns Work** → You give students an assignment from our library
2. **🔍 Student Explores Assignment** → Students navigate to their assignment page  
3. **🤖 Student Opens AI Tutor** → Students click to start their subject-specific ChatGPT tutor
4. **❓ Student Asks Questions** → Students work through assignment questions with the AI
5. **🧠 Student Demonstrates Understanding** → Students ask follow-up questions to show deep thinking
6. **💾 Student Saves & Shares** → Students save their conversation and share the link with you
7. **✅ Teacher Evaluates** → You grade based on the quality of their questioning and critical thinking

## 📋 Detailed Student Workflow

### Step 1: Teacher Assigns Work
**What you do:**
- Choose an assignment from our library or create your own
- Share the assignment link with students
- Set clear expectations about the conversation requirements
- Provide the grading rubric so students understand how they'll be evaluated

**Resources:**
- [Assignment Creation Guide]({{ '/framework/question-format/' | relative_url }})
- [Classroom Setup Tips]({{ '/framework/conversation-guidelines/' | relative_url }})

### Step 2: Student Explores Assignment
**What students do:**
- Navigate to their assignment page
- Read the learning objectives and questions
- Review any prerequisite knowledge needed
- Understand what they need to accomplish

**Teacher tip:** Encourage students to read the entire assignment before starting the AI conversation.

### Step 3: Student Opens AI Tutor
**What students do:**
- Click the "Start AI Tutor" button on their assignment
- Access the subject-specific ChatGPT tutor
- Begin a new conversation focused on their assignment

**Teacher tip:** Students should start each assignment with a fresh conversation to keep topics focused.

### Step 4: Student Works Through Questions
**What students do:**
- Ask the AI tutor about concepts in their assignment
- Work through practice problems with guidance
- Explore different approaches to problems
- Seek clarification on confusing topics

**Teacher tip:** Students should avoid asking for direct answers and instead ask for guidance and explanations.

### Step 5: Student Demonstrates Understanding
**What students do:**
- Ask follow-up questions like "Why does this work?"
- Request alternative solution methods
- Explore edge cases or related concepts
- Challenge assumptions and dig deeper

**This is the critical thinking component!** Students show understanding by:
- Asking "what if" questions
- Requesting multiple perspectives
- Questioning the AI's reasoning
- Making connections to other concepts

### Step 6: Student Saves & Shares
**What students do:**
- Copy the conversation link from ChatGPT
- Submit the link through your preferred method (LMS, email, etc.)
- Include any written reflection if required

**Teacher tip:** Provide clear instructions on how to share conversation links in your classroom setup.

### Step 7: Teacher Evaluates
**What you do:**
- Review the conversation using our grading rubric
- Look for evidence of critical thinking in their questions
- Assess depth of understanding through follow-up questions
- Provide feedback on both content knowledge and questioning skills

## 📈 Assessment Framework

### What to Look For in Student Conversations

**🌟 Excellent Critical Thinking:**
- Students ask "why" and "how" questions
- They request multiple approaches to problems
- They challenge AI responses with follow-up questions
- They make connections to other concepts

**✅ Good Understanding:**
- Students ask clarifying questions
- They seek explanations, not just answers
- They show curiosity about underlying concepts

**❌ Needs Improvement:**
- Students only ask for direct answers
- Limited follow-up or deeper questioning
- Passive acceptance of AI responses

### Sample Assessment Questions
When reviewing conversations, ask yourself:
- Did the student demonstrate curiosity beyond the basic question?
- How many follow-up questions did they ask?
- Did they challenge or verify the AI's explanations?
- Do their questions show understanding of the underlying concepts?

## 🚀 Getting Started Checklist

### Before Your First Assignment

- [ ] **Browse Available Assignments** - Find content that fits your curriculum
- [ ] **Test an AI Tutor** - Experience the student perspective yourself  
- [ ] **Review the Grading Rubric** - Understand how to evaluate conversations
- [ ] **Set Student Expectations** - Explain the questioning approach to students
- [ ] **Choose Submission Method** - Decide how students will share conversation links

### For Each Assignment

- [ ] **Share Assignment Link** - Send students to the specific assignment page
- [ ] **Provide Clear Instructions** - Explain what quality questioning looks like
- [ ] **Set Deadlines** - Give enough time for thoughtful exploration
- [ ] **Review Conversations** - Use the rubric to evaluate critical thinking
- [ ] **Provide Feedback** - Help students improve their questioning skills

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### Encouraging Deep Thinking
- **Model good questions** in class before assignments
- **Share examples** of excellent student conversations (anonymously)
- **Emphasize process over answers** - the thinking matters more than being "right"
- **Celebrate curiosity** when students ask unexpected or complex questions

### Common Challenges & Solutions

**"Students just ask for answers"**
→ Emphasize that questioning quality affects their grade, not answer correctness

**"Conversations are too short"**  
→ Set minimum requirements (e.g., "Ask at least 5 follow-up questions")

**"Students don't know what to ask"**
→ Provide question starters: "Why does...", "What if...", "How is this related to..."

**"AI gives wrong information"**
→ Perfect teaching moment! Students should learn to verify and question AI responses
