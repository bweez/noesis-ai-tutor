This assignment is designed to help students develop a deep understanding of linear equations through guided discovery and critical thinking.

## Assignment Overview

Students will work through a series of interconnected questions that build understanding of linear equations from multiple perspectives:

1. **Algebraic Manipulation** - Master the mechanics of solving equations
2. **Graphical Representation** - Visualize solutions and understand slope-intercept form  
3. **Real-World Applications** - Apply mathematical concepts to practical problems

## Instructions for Students

Work through each question thoughtfully, showing your reasoning at each step. The AI tutor is there to guide you, not give you answers. Ask yourself:

- What method should I use and why?
- How can I check if my answer makes sense?
- What does this solution mean in the context of the problem?
- How does the algebraic solution relate to the graph?

## Getting Started

Begin with the first question and work through them in order. Each question builds on the previous one, so take time to understand each concept before moving forward.

Remember: The goal is not just to get the right answer, but to understand the process and reasoning behind the solution.
