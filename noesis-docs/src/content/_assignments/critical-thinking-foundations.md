  ## Critical Thinking Assessment
  
  **Advanced (4):**
  - Consistently identifies hidden assumptions
  - Evaluates multiple perspectives thoroughly
  - Constructs well-reasoned arguments with strong evidence
  - Demonstrates metacognitive awareness of thinking process
  
  **Proficient (3):**
  - Usually identifies obvious assumptions
  - Considers different viewpoints
  - Provides adequate reasoning for conclusions
  - Shows some awareness of thinking strategies
  
  **Developing (2):**
  - Sometimes identifies assumptions with guidance
  - Limited consideration of alternative perspectives
  - Reasoning is present but may have gaps
  - Beginning awareness of thinking process
  
  **Beginning (1):**
  - Rarely identifies assumptions independently
  - Accepts single perspective without question
  - Limited or flawed reasoning
  - Little awareness of thinking strategies
teacher_notes: |
  **Focus Areas:**
  - Emphasize questioning and exploration over quick answers
  - Model critical thinking language ("What assumptions are we making?", "What evidence supports this?")
  - Encourage students to explain their reasoning process
  
  **Discussion Prompts:**
  - "How do you know this is true?"
  - "What might someone who disagrees say?"
  - "What assumptions are we making here?"
  - "What additional information would be helpful?"

This assignment introduces students to fundamental critical thinking skills through mathematical and logical reasoning problems.

## Purpose

Critical thinking is essential across all subjects and life situations. This assignment helps students:

- Recognize the difference between facts and opinions
- Question assumptions and evaluate evidence
- Build logical arguments step-by-step
- Apply systematic thinking to problem-solving

## Approach

Rather than rushing to answers, focus on the *process* of thinking:

1. **Pause** - What is the question really asking?
2. **Examine** - What information do I have? What am I assuming?
3. **Reason** - What logical steps lead to a conclusion?
4. **Reflect** - Does my reasoning make sense? Are there other possibilities?

## Key Skills Developed

- **Assumption Identification** - Recognizing unstated beliefs or premises
- **Evidence Evaluation** - Determining the quality and relevance of support
- **Logical Reasoning** - Building valid arguments from premises to conclusions
- **Perspective Taking** - Considering multiple viewpoints on an issue

The AI tutor will guide you through these thinking processes, helping you develop habits of mind that serve you in mathematics, science, literature, and everyday decision-making.
