Feature: Accessibility Standards
  As a user with accessibility needs
  I want the framework to meet WCAG standards
  So that I can access all content and functionality

  Background:
    Given the Jekyll development server is running
    And I am using assistive technology

  @wip
  Scenario: Homepage meets accessibility standards
    When I visit the homepage
    Then the page should have proper heading structure
    And all images should have alt text
    And the color contrast should meet WCAG AA standards
    And the page should be keyboard navigable

  @wip
  Scenario: Navigation is accessible
    Given I am on the homepage
    When I navigate using only the keyboard
    Then I should be able to reach all interactive elements
    And focus indicators should be visible
    And screen reader announcements should be meaningful

  @wip
  Scenario: Subject pages are accessible
    Given I am on a subject page
    When I use a screen reader
    Then the content structure should be clear
    And all functionality should be available via keyboard
    And form elements should have proper labels
